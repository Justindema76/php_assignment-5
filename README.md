## Project 7-1:	Use a drop-down list 
* ## The View/Update Customer page

* For this project, you’ll modify the Manage Customers application so it uses a drop-down list to display the country. Also, you’ll allow the user to use this drop-down to change the country.

## Operation

*	When the user selects a customer, the View/Update Customer page should display the country in a drop-down list, and it should select the correct country for the customer. 
*	The user can use the Country drop-down list to change the country for the customer.
Specifications
*	In the Country drop-down list, display all countries that are available in the countries table in the tech_support database.
*	When the page is first displayed, make sure to select the correct country for the specified customer. To do that, write code that sets the selected attribute of the <option> tag for the appropriate country.

* ## NOTE - A column for country was added for testing
